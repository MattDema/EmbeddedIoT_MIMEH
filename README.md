## Idea of the project üí°

---
<!--=========================================================================-->

The main idea of the project is to build a robotic hand, which moves using a dedicated servomotor for each finger.
The hand structure is composed of 3D-printed components, while movement is controlled through two different modes.
The first uses the mediapipe library OpenCV to track the movements of the user fingers, captured by the computer webcam.
The Manual Control Mode is used to move the fingers, singularly changing the angle value of the related servomotor using input joysticks.
Mode selection is controlled by a Texas Instrument board, which displays a menu on its integrated display. It's possible to move within the menu using the joystick and button sensors.
The Texas Instruments board send the inputs for the Arduino board which selects and moves the servomotors accordingly.

#### Setting Up Python üêç

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the required dependencies.
Ensure you have Python **3.8+** installed. You can download it from the official Python website:
[Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
After installation, verify the installation by running:
```sh
python --version
```
or, on some systems:
```sh
python3 --version
```

#### Libraries Python üìö

For optimal program performance, it is recommended to use a machine with a dedicated and powerful graphic card. However, the program can also run on less powerful systems. The required libraries are:

- `cv2`
- `mediapipe`
- `importlib`
- `os`
- `tkinter`
- `POL`
- `sys`
- `time`
- `math`
- `collections`
- `pydantic`
- `numpy`
- `pyserial`
- `threading`

#### Library Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

It is recommended to install all these libraries before running the program to avoid errors during runtime. Below are the commands to install the libraries via `pip`:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install mediapipe
pip install importlib-metadata

```

## Getting Started üöÄ

---

<!--=========================================================================-->

### Setting up the Hand ‚úã

The project begins with the construction of the hand components, which are ***3D-printed using PLA material***. Some parts require *milling to reduce friction* between the joints of the phalanges, ***improving overall movement performance***.  
The components are assembled using **screws and hot glue**:  
- **Screws** are primarily used to connect the phalanges.  
- **Hot glue** secures other parts, such as the forearm and the springs.  

Finger movement is achieved through a combination of ***springs and fishing line***:  
- The **springs** provide a constant force that helps return the fingers to their default position.  
- The **fishing line** connects the fingers to the servomotors, ***transmitting motion from the servos to the fingers***.

### Setting up Wiring üîå

---

The wiring process starts by connecting the **servomotors** to the **Arduino board** through a breadboard.  
Each servo operates with **three wires**:  
- **Two wires for power** (*GND and 5V*).  
- **One wire for the signal**.  

To supply power:  
- Connect the breadboard to the Arduino board using **male-to-male wires**, linking the ***GND and 5V pins*** (*since the servos require 5V*).  
- Finally, connect the ***signal wires to the digital pins of the Arduino board***, allowing for individual control of each motor.


### Setting up Arduino-Texas Instrument Communication üîÑ

---


The wiring for **Arduino-Texas Instrument communication** begins by connecting a ***logical level shifter*** to the breadboard.  
This component is **essential** for transmitting signals between boards ***operating at different voltage levels***:  
- ***Texas Instrument works at 3.3V.***  
- ***Arduino operates at 5V.***

1. **üõ†Ô∏è Powering the Breadboard**
    - **Connect the 5V output from Arduino** to one of the breadboard's power rails.  
    - **Connect the 3.3V output from Texas Instrument** to a separate power rail.  
    - ***Ensure both devices share a common ground (GND)*** on the breadboard.  

2. **üîå Connecting the Logical Level Shifter**
   - **LV3 pin** ‚Üí *Connect to pin 3.2 of the Texas Instrument.*  
   - **GND pins** ‚Üí ***Connect both to the 3.3V and 5V sides of the level shifter.***  
   - **LV (Low Voltage) pin** ‚Üí *Connect to 3.3V (power from Texas Instrument).*  
   - **HV4 pin** ‚Üí ***Connect to pin 1 of the Arduino.***  
   - **HV (High Voltage) pin** ‚Üí *Connect to 5V (power from Arduino).*  
   - **Pin 0 of the Arduino** ‚Üí ***Connect to pin 2.3 of the Texas Instrument.***  

This setup ***ensures correct signal voltage conversion***, allowing **reliable communication between the two boards** ***without risking damage due to voltage mismatches.***

### Setting up the Arduino Software üî®

   - Open Arduino IDE and go to *Sketch ‚Üí Include Library ‚Üí Manage Libraries*.
   - In the Library Manager, search for *"Servo"*.
   - Select the Arduino Servo Library and click Install.
3. ***Select the Correct Board and Port***
   - Navigate to Tools ‚Üí Board and select the correct Arduino model (e.g., *Arduino Uno*, *Mega*, etc.).
   - Go to *Tools ‚Üí Port* and **select the COM port associated with your Arduino board**.
4. ***Upload the Firmware***
   - Open the Arduino project file (*.ino*).
   - Verify the code by clicking the *Verify (Check) button*.
   - Upload it to the board by clicking the *(Upload) button*.
5. ***Check Serial Communication***
   - Open **Serial Monitor** (*Tools ‚Üí Serial Monitor*) and set the baud rate to match the one in your code (e.g., *9600*).
   - Ensure that the board receives and sends signals correctly.

## User guide üìë

---

<!--=========================================================================-->

The **robotic hand** operates in ***two different modes***, which can be selected using the **Texas Instruments board**. Follow the steps below to use each mode:

1. ***Hand Tracking Mode (Mediapipe)***

   This mode allows the robotic hand to replicate the user's finger movements in real time using MediaPipe and a computer webcam.
     Steps:
      1. **Connect** the *Texas Instruments board* and the *Arduino board* to the computer.
      2. Open *PyCharm* (or ur *Python IDE*) and run the `main.py` file:
              ```
              python main.py
              ```
      3. The script *establishes a serial communication* with the *Arduino*.
      4. The MediaPipe library tracks the user‚Äôs hand movements through the webcam.
      5. The robotic hand mimics the movements detected by MediaPipe.
     
2. ***Manual Control Mode (Joystick):***

   This mode allows for *individual finger control using the joystick* on the *Texas Instruments board*.
     Steps:
      1. Select the *Manual Control Mode* from the menu on the *Texas Instruments board*.
      2. *Use the joystick* to navigate through the menu and *select the finger to move*.
      3. Adjust the joystick position to change the angle of the selected finger.
      4. To **exit** this mode, perform a *left shift with the joystick*.
      5. Once a mode is selected, the *Texas Instruments board* sends the commands to the *Arduino*, which then controls the servomotors accordingly.
